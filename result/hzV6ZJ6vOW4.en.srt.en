1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Drawdown is one of the most important, but also most misunderstood metrics in trading.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,160
Most traders don't understand how it's calculated, how it affects their strategies, how their

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,420
stop loss levels feed into it, and most importantly, 8 out of 10 traders have no idea that not

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,620
all drawdowns are the same.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,780
So in this video, we're breaking down the different types of drawdowns you absolutely

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,720
need to understand, how each one impacts your strategy, and how to use that knowledge

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,000
to fix what's broken without throwing away a perfectly good trading plan.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,720
Let's dive in.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,520
First things first.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,900
Let's pin down exactly what we mean by drawdown.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,860
In trading as you open and close positions, the value of your account will increase or

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,260
decrease.

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,180
A drawdown is simply the decrease from the highest point of your account balance or

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,860
equity to a lower point that follows.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,320
To better visualize this, picture a roller coaster.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,400
As it climbs higher, each dip afterward counts as a drawdown.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,080
Some dips are more significant than others, and we usually express this measurement

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,960
as a percentage.

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,060
That percentage is your reality check.

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,660
It tells you how much your account shrank during a losing streak, and it gives you

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,680
a clear sense of the risk and volatility your strategy carries.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,480
But here's the thing.

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,960
Not all those drawdowns are calculated the same.

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,180
So let's break it down.

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,060
Forget what you've heard.

26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,920
At this stage, there are really only two types of drawdowns you need to understand.

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,220
Absolute drawdown and relative drawdown.

28
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,080
Let's start with an absolute drawdown.

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,560
This measures how far your account balance drops below your original starting balance.

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
Here's a scenario.

31
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,660
You start with $10,000 and you make a 50% gain.

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,360
So now you're sitting at $15,000, feeling unstoppable, but you follow your favorite

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,900
get-rich-guru and go all in with your profits.

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,760
And surprise, the market humbles you, and your account drops to $10,000.

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,600
You've lost $5,000 in profit, so your drawdown is 5%, right?

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,120
Wrong.

37
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,620
Your absolute drawdown is zero.

38
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,460
This is because you never went below your original starting balance.

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,520
Going back to our roller coaster example, absolute drawdown doesn't care about how

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,620
high you went on the ride.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,580
It only cares about the distance between the trough and where you started.

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,520
As you can imagine, this type of drawdown has its pitfalls, since it only measures

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,300
losses below your original deposit.

44
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,240
That means it can make a trading strategy's performance look safer than it really is.

45
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,320
Relative drawdown, on the other hand, is an industry favorite for evaluating strategies.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,260
It measures the percentage drop from your highest equity peak to the lowest point

47
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,800
that follows.

48
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,260
The key is that it's dynamic.

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,320
As your gains grow, so does the scale it measures from, keeping risk proportional

50
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,240
to your account's growth.

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,660
For example, if your account grows from $10,000 to $15,000, but then for some

52
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:25,020
reason drops to $13,000, your relative drawdown is based on the $15,000 peak,

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,380
not your starting balance, making the drawdown 13%.

54
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,360
This makes it a true reflection of how much of your recent gains you've given

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,140
back to the market.

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,480
So why is that important?

57
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,940
Imagine you're looking at a strategy's equity curve.

58
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,520
You could choose to invest in that strategy at any point along that curve,

59
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,960
and you want to know the relative drawdown risk you might face from your

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,560
point of entry.

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,640
Absolute drawdown won't tell you that and offers no insight into

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,080
potential losses from a current or recent peak.

63
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,360
Now that we understand these two types of drawdowns, when should you use

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,800
each one?

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,040
Relative drawdown is best when you want to know the realistic, ongoing

66
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,860
measure of risk.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,460
It's especially useful for investors who evaluate strategies over time.

68
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,960
By showing potential losses from the most recent gains, it's a powerful

69
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,700
tool for strategy comparison and performance tracking.

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,040
Absolute drawdown, on the other hand, is better for assessing the

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,780
maximum risk taken relative to your original capital.

72
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,020
Long-term investors or funds focused on capital preservation often pay close

73
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,340
attention to this metric to ensure the initial principle was never at

74
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:20,960
serious risk.

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,420
It's most useful for evaluating the starting phase of a strategy without

76
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,600
factoring in what happens to profits afterward.

77
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,560
Now while these are the two main types of drawdowns, you might find

78
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,240
variations of them in the trading space.

79
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,140
For example, you'll come across what's called trailing drawdown.

80
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,280
Trailing drawdown works like a live, moving version of relative

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,660
drawdown.

82
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,700
As your account equity increases, the trailing drawdown threshold

83
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,860
rises with it, maintaining a strict buffer below the highest point.

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,600
Unlike relative drawdown, which is more of a retrospective

85
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,740
measurement, trailing drawdown enforces limits in real time by

86
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,980
always anchoring to the highest peak of equity.

87
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,840
Many retail prop firms love this mechanism because it tightly manages

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,160
risk and prevents traders from giving back too much of their hard

89
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,780
earned gains.

90
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,420
So now that we understand how each drawdown works and why a trader

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,700
or investor might use them, the question is, how can you, as a

92
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,340
trader, apply this knowledge to improve your own performance?

93
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,720
By understanding drawdown, you can identify what aspects of your

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,820
strategy need adjustment.

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,100
For example, if your absolute drawdown is high, it could mean the

96
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,540
strategy is fundamentally flawed.

97
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,060
You're losing a significant portion of your initial capital.

98
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,240
However, that alone doesn't tell the whole story.

99
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,520
A strategy could recover from an early slump and trend higher beyond

100
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,500
your starting balance.

101
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,020
So that is why the relative drawdown becomes valuable.

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,060
If your swings between gains and losses are too large, a high

103
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,060
relative drawdown may reveal that your stop loss settings are

104
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,360
either too wide, letting losses run too far or too tight,

105
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,800
triggering stops too often.

106
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,320
You can then optimize your exits, reducing your relative drawdown,

107
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,180
turning a choppy, unattractive equity curve into a much smoother,

108
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,300
more stable one.

109
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,700
Drawdown analysis also feeds into other important performance

110
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,040
metrics, one of the most useful being maximum adverse excursion

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,140
or MAE.

112
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,080
MAE measures how far.

113
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,540
On average, a trade moved against you before it was closed.

114
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,340
It's typically compared to the trade's final outcome and plotted

115
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:04,860
on a grid.

116
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,920
This grid maps all trades from your strategy, showing each

117
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,580
trade's maximum drawdown versus its closing result.

118
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,040
If you notice a cluster of trades with large drawdowns,

119
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,700
but small profits, that's a red flag.

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,260
It suggests you're holding on to losing positions for too long.

121
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,080
The goal is to shift your trades toward the top right of the grid,

122
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,720
where drawdowns are smaller and profits are larger.

123
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,420
There's also maximum favorable excursion or MFE,

124
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,400
which measures how far a trade moved in your favor before closing.

125
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,920
MFE can highlight whether your take profit levels need optimization.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,960
For example, if trades often move far in your favor,

127
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,880
but you hold for too long and you give back some of your

128
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,140
profits before you close, there's a strong chance you need

129
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,060
to time exits better.

130
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,540
We can also calculate recovery factor and much more.

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,400
Recognizing how critical these calculations are for traders

132
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
aiming to build a real edge in the markets,

133
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,440
we've added a powerful metric to our signals and overlays

134
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,440
backtester, the potential ratio, displayed right on the dashboard

135
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,980
alongside other key stats.

136
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,040
This metric measures the relationship between your trade's

137
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,520
total maximum potential profits and total maximum potential losses.

138
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,960
The key word is potential.

139
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,040
A higher potential ratio means your entries consistently

140
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,880
offer stronger upside relative to the risk taken,

141
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,740
signaling that your strategy has the capacity to deliver

142
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,400
more gains than losses.

143
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,800
Conversely, a low ratio can expose aggressive risk taking,

144
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,720
where entries are more likely to lead to significant drawdowns.

145
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,100
Paired with our AI backtesting assistant,

146
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,700

00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,300
this metric becomes a precision tool for fine-tuning your approach

149
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,460

Drawdown Secrets Every Trader MUST Know.144p[hzV6ZJ6vOW4].mkv
